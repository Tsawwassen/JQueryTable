## Weekend Project, JQuery Table Project
Make edit values in a table in different functions.

## Goal
Refresh myself on JQuery, and make a small app that can make updates to a table, and that the code can be easily added to Andrew G's code.

## Plan of action
1. Display a table.
2. Filter the table by a column value.
3. Edit values in a specific column.
    - Note, the edits should only apply to the rows that are displayed.

## Post Weekend Project Comments
